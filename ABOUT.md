- I wanted to use the serial monitor to know if the push button pressed or not and the state of the LED ON or OFF and to read the temperature sensor and to write it on the serial monitor
- I've used the arduino board in a college project to make a smart car and have features by different sensors but I've used it in level two so my knowledge is very good at using the arduino and writing a code but in level three I have used another board "cortex TM4-C123"  in making a distance meter and my knowledge become much more better and also I am good at using different registers but I've not used it in a big project

- I wanted to use the serial monitor to know if the push button pressed or not and the state of the LED ON or OFF and to read the temperature sensor and to write it on the serial monitor
- I've used the arduino board in a college project in making a smart car and have features by different sensors but I've used it in the last year so my knowledge is not very good at using the arduino and writing a code but in the next year I've used another board "cortex TM4-C123" and used the tiva c in making a distance meter and my knowledge is much better but not perfect and I am good in using different registers but I've not used it in a big project
